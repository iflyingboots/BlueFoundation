# BlueFoundation

![BlueFoundation](docs/images/Logo.png)

BlueFoundation is an elegant Bluetooth library for iOS, which is built on top of CoreBluetooth framework. It helps you scan, connect and manage peripherals, providing high-level Bluetooth common operations, such as write, read and receive notify values, in well-defined callback interfaces.

This project aims to reduce the efforts when an iOS developer tries to communicate with Bluetooth devices. Save time and see the results, in a short time, even if you has very little knowledge on Bluetooth terms.

Working with Bluetooth devices should be just like what you do when you send network requests.
